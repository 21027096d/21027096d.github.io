Additional feature 1:responsive layout design with div and span

In language.html,when view mouse over a language box,
it will have have the colour in the data and the activity change. 
The user will cleary know what he/she mouseover in. 

How it works? It is using a div(red colour) and a span(yellow colour).
when viewer mouseover a box which contain the language I know, 
viewer is mouse over on a div,
and the same time he/she also mouse on a span, 
therefore it reverse the div colour and span colour in that time.
